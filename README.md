# Micro-Gird-Panel-Design
This is where we share our tool for managing renewable energy systems, like solar panels and wind turbines, in microgrids. Our panel lets you see how much energy is being made and used in real-time. It also helps balance the load on the grid, making sure everything runs smoothly

Overview
The microgrid panel is designed to efficiently manage power from both solar and the main supply to meet the demands of two loads. It incorporates necessary safety features and switching mechanisms to ensure seamless operation.

Power Input Section:
Two input terminals for connecting the solar panels and the main supply.
Protection devices such as fuses and surge protectors.

Power Management Unit (PMU):
Microcontroller-based unit or PLC based unit for monitoring and controlling power flow.
Algorithms for prioritizing power sources and load management.

Switching Mechanism:
Relays or solid-state switches for seamless switching between power sources.
Circuitry to prevent backflow and ensure safety.

Load Distribution:
Circuitry to distribute power to the two loads.
Overcurrent protection for each load.
